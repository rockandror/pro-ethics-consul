  welcome:
    introduction: |-
      <p>Thank you for participating in our consultation. The research project PRO-Ethics is working on an ethics framework to help research funding organizations organize ethical stakeholder participation. With this consultation, we hope to receive input that helps us further improve the framework. The consultation is made up of two parts:</p>
      <p><b>Part I</b> entails an excerpt of our theoretical framework and a survey. We would ask you to read the excerpt and answer three questions regarding challenges that funding organizations may experience when organizing stakeholder participation. Our goal is to better understand whether other funding organizations also recognize these experiences, and what other obstacles could impede an ethical participatory process.</p>
      <p><b>Part II</b> entails an open annotation process where we present the core of the ethics framework, i.e., our Tools & Guidelines. This document gives a brief introduction and offers six main questions designed to guide funding organizations in designing, implementing, and evaluating participatory processes. Please read the document and provide us with any comments you deem relevant for improving the framework. For instance, do you find this part to be helpful, clear, and comprehensive enough for organizing participatory processes? Are there any essential elements missing? Any suggestions for improving the framework are welcome.</p>
      <p>Thank you very much on behalf of the PRO-Ethics consortium.</p>
